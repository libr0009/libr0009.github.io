              <p>Hello, most people call me Gabby! When asked to describe myself,
                  I never know exactly what to say. Though one here I will try to describe
                  myself to the best of my abilities. <br>
                  I am 18 years old, and since I was a little girl I loved art and everything about it.
                  Another thing that I loved was video games, at the age of 5 I was playing GTA and all types <br> of games 
                  on my computer or on the playstation thanks to my Dad.
