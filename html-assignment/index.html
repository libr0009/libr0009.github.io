              <p>Hello, most people call me Gabby! When asked to describe myself,
                  I never know exactly what to say. Though one here I will try to describe
                  myself to the best of my abilities. <br>
                  I am 18 years old, born on the 12<sup>th</sup> of September and since I was a little girl I loved art and everything about it.
                  Another thing that I loved was video games, at the age of 5 I was playing GTA and all types <br> of games 
                  on my computer or on the playstation thanks to my Dad.         
              </p>
              <p>I love Japanese and Middle Eastern cuisine, my go-to
                spot to eat and spend the most money in Ottawa is Gyubee, and Osmows; they never disappoint. Although Japanese
                and middle eastern cuisine are my favourites, I will eat almost everything! I am a foodie and I love trying new foods, one of
                my favourite activities to do lately is discover new places to eat in the city.
            </p>

                Is something I will always try live by. Life is too short to waste.
